my planning stage for this project

1. create the prompts for user to choose as the following
    1) view current balance
    2) record a debit
    3) record a credit
    4) exit
        user input must be a number between 1 and 4 anythoing else is 
        invalid and some message should display letting user know to
        choose again

option 1
    user chooses view current balance 
        check to see if user has any information stored
            if user does have a balance output that info
                break out of this option
    initial prompt to choose is given

option 2
    user chooses debit 
        user input recorded as string- check if an input can be coverted 
        float at the same time if not
            input needs to be converted to float
                this debit cannot be make balance negative
                    if user inputs an amount greater than balance
                        user is given a prompt stating this amount
                            exceeds balance and to choose a different amount 
                                prompt user for new amount
                                information is recorded in memory or database
                                    some message is printed out saying everything has 
                                        been completed
                                           break out of this option
    initial prompt to choose is given

        

option 3
    user chooses to credit
        input is recorded as string and needs to be converted to float
            input is recorded and stored in memory or database
                prompt given saying credit was completed
                    break 
    initial prompt to choose is given 

option 4
    user chooses exit as their option
        time delay
            prompt given to user awknoledging their request
